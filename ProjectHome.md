This is a draft set of GWT bindings for Google Maps API v3.

What works today:  Maps, InfoWindows (which can include Widgets), Markers, Polygons,
Events (for the above)

What hasn't been implemented yet (but you can implement with JSNI):  Geocoding, Controls, Polylines, Directions, Elevation, Custom Overlays

There are no official releases, but the code is being actively used.  You can checkout the code and build simply with Eclipse and ant.

If you would like to add to this project, submit a patch.  If it's not terrible, you will be made a committer.
