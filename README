Branch structure:
/eclipse - contains the eclipse project files (no source)
/gwt-maps - contains the auto-generated bindings for the gwt-maps V3 library
/gwt-maps/maps - source root
/gwt-maps/maps/src - the source code for the gwt-maps bindings
/gwt-maps/maps/test - the source code for the gwt-maps unit tests
/gwt-maps/samples - the source code for the gwt-maps samples

Opening Project:
- In Eclipse add a Linked Resource
  1. Window -> Preferences
  2. Expand General -> Workspace -> Linked Resources
  3. Click new.
     Name: MAPS_API_ROOT
     Location: path to /gwt-maps folder
- Import project into workspace
  1. File -> Import
  2. Select General -> Existing Projects into Workspace
  3. Select /eclipse as the root directory
  4. Click finish.

There will be compile errors initially, the auto-generated code is mostly OK but there are a few items the generator could not handle which we can add manually.
